TODO:

Phase 8:
(FOOTER LINKS):

- Add about page
- Add contact page
- Add returns / deliveries page

Phase 9:
(PURCHASE)

- Form with email, address, billing info.

Phase 10:
(PURCHASE COMPLETED)

- Displays that the order has been received.

Optimizations:

- Add some kind of animation for when users add something to cart, the change in the cart icon is kind of hard to notice
- Save timestamps in localStorage for when data was last retrieved, retrieve data if it's been X amount of time since last request.
